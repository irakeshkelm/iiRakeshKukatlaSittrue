We communicated via email, several months ago, context was BU
incubator. I had stopped by your office.


I look forward to your ideas about sourcing financing or sourcing
connections with Finance leaders, Business leaders or Government
leaders. (https://github.com/irakeshkelm).


Please, zoom me an email at your convenience. I can also, stop by
your office or private residence. You are most welcome to stop by my
private residence at 7 Elm Street, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (aka
Great-America).


Thank you,
Rakesh.
