Hi Linus,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


I have heard from public sources of information that you have an
interest in ARM-ing! (aka hardware) GIT-ing! (aka sharing), Linux-ing!
(aka Independent interest
and Militia) and tour-ing (aka speaking).


I have an interest in Expanding and updating the Independent interest,
around earth, moon's, planet's, star's and galaxies.

I am very much interested in checking out your git and linux. It
would be wonderful, if you are able to share your tour-ing with me.


Zoom me a response, or invite me to your place.


I reside in a very humble private residence (7 Elm
Street, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (Banana republicans aka United
slaves, aka Romani; USA = United slave america). However, you are
always and most welcome to stop by (at your convenience).


PS: Also, forward to family (aka open source) - both up and down.


Thank you and happy ARM-ing, GIT-ing, Linux-ing and Tour-ing
Rakesh.
