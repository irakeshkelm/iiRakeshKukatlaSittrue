Hi Elon,
If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).
I have heard from public sources of information that you have an
interest in making humans an inter-planetary species.
I have an interest in Expanding and updating the Independent interest,
around earth, planets and galaxy (github.com/irakeshkelm).
Shoot me a response, or invite me to your place.
Unfortunately, I reside in a very humble private residence (7 Elm
Street, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (aka Great-America) However, you
are most welcome to stop by (at your convenience).


Thank you,
Rakesh.
