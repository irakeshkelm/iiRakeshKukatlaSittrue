Hi Harvey,


I am having difficulties getting to my doctor's office (Lourdes
orthopedics - Riverside side) on Riverside drive as a consequence of
my disability. In addition, I am having other daily life issues, such
as; getting groceries, going shopping, going to the park, going to the
cemetery and going to the river and hills.


It would be wonderful, if you are able to clear some of my
difficulties and daily life issues.


I have and continue to pursue all avenues (individuals, organizations)
available to me, such as; friends, neighbors, non-profit
organizations, for profit organizations and government.


Thank you,
Rakesh.
